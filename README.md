# Go sync.Map Load: Handling Empty Interface{}

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Go's `sync.Map` and its `Load` method. The `Load` method returns an empty interface (`interface{}`), which requires careful type assertion to avoid runtime panics.  This example shows the error and provides a robust solution.

## The Problem

The `sync.Map.Load` method returns an `interface{}`.  If you don't properly type assert the returned value before using it, you may encounter a runtime panic.

## The Solution

The solution involves correctly type asserting the result of `Load` to the expected type.  Failure to do so may lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors. Always check the ok value in `Load` to ensure the key exists.
